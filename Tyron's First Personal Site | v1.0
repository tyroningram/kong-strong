    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Tyron Ingram.</h2>
    <h3>Front End Engineer in the making.</h3>
    <p>
      This is just a little test. Personal Website v1.0 - if you will.
      <br />Here is a picture of my cat.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/justHTML/thecat.JPG"
      alt="Purzel - the cat"
      width="300"
      height="200"
    />
    <p>
      Anyway... I`ll keep this site as a reminder - where it started and where
      it got me.
    </p>
    <h4>Thanks, cya!</h4>
